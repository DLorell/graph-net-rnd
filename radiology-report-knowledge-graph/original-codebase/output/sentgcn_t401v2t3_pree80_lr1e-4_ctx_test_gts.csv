no acute radiographic cardiopulmonary process . the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for size and contour . the lungs are normally inflated without evidence of focal airspace disease pleural effusion or pneumothorax . osseous structures are within normal limits for patient age . 
no acute disease . left upper extremity pic catheter tip <unk> within left subclavian vein . findings <unk> <unk> primordial . the heart is normal in size . the mediastinum is unremarkable . left upper extremity pic catheter tip overlies the distal aspect of the left clavicle <unk> within the subclavian vein . there is no pneumothorax . the lungs are mildly hyperinflated but clear . deformity of the lateral left 6th rib <unk> old injury . 
clear lungs with no suspicious pulmonary nodules or masses . lungs are clear . no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces . heart and mediastinum of normal size and contour . 
no evidence of active disease . heart size is at the upper limits of normal . the pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits . the lungs are free of focal airspace disease . no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen . degenerative changes are present in the spine . no noncalcified nodules are identified . 
normal chest . heart is normal in size . no focal consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax . no acute or destructive bone abnormality . 
patchy opacity left base may represent evolving infiltrate . small right pleural effusion . low lung volumes . question patchy opacity left base . no pneumothorax . osseous structures intact . small right effusion . 
no acute cardiopulmonary findings heart size within normal limits . no alveolar consolidation no findings of pleural effusion or pulmonary edema . no pneumothorax .
